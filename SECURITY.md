# Security Policy

`wickra-verify` is verification software: it recomputes a deterministic backtest
report and a canonical hash from a `(spec, data)` pair and compares it against a
claimed report. It places no orders, holds no secret material, and opens no
authenticated connections. The attack surface is therefore narrow — principally
the parsing of untrusted `Claim` (strategy + claimed report) and candle data JSON as it
crosses the C ABI and WASM boundary. See [THREAT_MODEL.md](THREAT_MODEL.md) for
the asset and trust-boundary breakdown.

## Supported versions

Nothing is published yet. Security fixes target `main`, and will carry into
`0.1.0` -- the version the manifests declare and the first that will be
released. No earlier version exists to support.

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| `main`  | ✅        |
| `0.1.0` (unreleased) | ✅ |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately via GitHub's
[security advisories](https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-verify/security/advisories/new)
form rather than a public issue. We aim to acknowledge within 72 hours.

Because the entire product value is **determinism**, a report that a given
`(spec, data)` yields a **different `report_hash` across two languages or two
runs** is treated as a security-class defect: it breaks the verifiability
guarantee. Please include the spec, the data, and both hashes.

## Scope

In scope: memory-safety or panic issues reachable by parsing untrusted input at
the FFI/WASM boundary; any cross-language or cross-run divergence of
`report_hash` for identical input; canonicalization ambiguities.

Out of scope: the correctness of a strategy's economics; third-party registries;
denial of service from pathologically large inputs supplied by the caller.
